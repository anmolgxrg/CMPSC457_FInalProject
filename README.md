### Aim
The Blastar game, developed in OpenGL, is inspired by the classic "Space Invaders." This 2D game employs sprites and shapes to replicate a visually engaging and interactive gaming experience. Players control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen, shooting projectiles to destroy incoming enemies that descend from the top. Despite its simplicity, Blastar fulfills all project requirements and showcases fundamental principles of graphics programming.
