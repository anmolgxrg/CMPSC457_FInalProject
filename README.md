### Aim
My aim for this final project is to create an arcade game using the OpenGL framework, incorporating various sprites and shapes. The game currently features basic functionalities, including player movement, projectile firing, and enemy elimination. While there is no lighting implemented yet, I plan to enhance the game further, potentially turning it into a more complex version of Space Invaders with multiple levels and diverse environments. This will be done as part of the CMPSC 457 course.
